Here we are today with version 4.5.0 of the NewsBlur Android App. This is a great release because we took our time to update and improve a number of things about the app.

The app now has the common header shared between all of NewsBlur’s first-class clients (web, iOS, and Android).

Here’s the full changelog for version 4.5.0 (October 2015):

- Reduced CPU and battery usage
- New activities/interactions list
- Updated feed list UI
- Explainers for empty lists
- Support for more types of alt/title text on images
- Better error messaging
- Tons of bug fixes, especially around offline usage

It’s a [free download](http://www.newsblur.com/android) and continues to get faster and more reliable. If you want to vote on which features you’d like to see next, [comment here on NewsBlur’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aandroid).
