Exactly four months ago, Jason Kottke found my project, [NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com), and tweeted:

In that time, every measure of traffic, paid subscriptions, and community feedback has cleared new heights on my revered munin charts. But I kept my full-time job and only worked on NewsBlur as a side-project, as I have been doing for the past two years.

I’m at a slow but steady trickle of users, enough of whom convert into paying premium subscribers to pay for the increasing number of servers (now costing almost $800/month!). But a vocal support forum and an ever-increasing trickle of payments aren’t what convinced me to dedicate myself full-time to my humble project.

What convinced me is that life’s too short.

## The only way to do great work is to love what you do

I’m following the better-half of my inner-Jobs and choosing to follow the path of doing what I love to do.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It’s going to be expensive on my part. There will be no paycheck, health insurance runs out in a few months, and even on an exceptionally good day, premium subscriptions bring in only about half of my former salary.

## Paying customers are keeping things afloat

It’s not that big a risk. Users are choosing to pay and choosing how much to pay. Some users opt to pay a $12/year at a buck a month, while some choose to pay $36/year at $3/month. The servers cost roughly .75x what premium subscriptions bring in. That gap between cost and revenue is growing steadily, as the servers I have are running at 25% capacity.

Maciej Ceglowski, of Pinboard fame, has written extensively about the scourge of free services not taking payments from users. From a recent February 2012 presentation, he [writes of the three types of services](http://pinboard.in/talks/biz.pdf) [pdf]:

> ### Business Model #1: Charge Money
> 
> This is a groundbreaking new approach where a site accepts fungible tokens of value in return for a product or service.
> 
> ### Business Model #2: Burn Money
> 
> ￼Find a sponsor with deep pockets and run at a loss indefinitely.
> 
> ### Business Model #3: Offer a Free Service and Fail
> 
> The most popular business model has been to offer a free service and then shut down (or transition to model #1).

You can look forward to new features, bug fixes, and an unending stream of progress, all because you’re paying me for the work I do. It’s a simple setup that helps me sleep at night. I’m building an honest product. You know what you’re paying for. And NewsBlur will continue to be ad-free, because ads are not part of the product that I want to use myself.

## So much time, so little to do. Strike that! Reverse it.

In what I can only consider a bizarrely wonderful coincidence, I see this the morning after I declared freedom:

The wind’s at my back, and I’m feeling pretty good about this.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>

The worse-half of my inner-Jobs insists on perfection and never gets anything shipped. The balancing act between better and done is about the only constant in this crazy dream to be a self-sustaining indie dev.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)

2. 

You should [follow NewsBlur’s development on Github](https://github.com/samuelclay). I live on props, so that’d make me feel even better.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:2)
