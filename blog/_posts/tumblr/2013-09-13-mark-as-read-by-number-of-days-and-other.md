Here’s a few big improvements for the NewsBlur website.

- The site title bar is now mounted to the bottom of the screen. This will allow you to mark a site/folder as read at any time.
- Marking as read can go back a configurable amount: 1, 3, 7, and 14 days back.

- If you’re reading in newest-first order, when you mark a site as read, any newer stories that have come in since you’ve loaded the site will no longer be marked as read.
- When you add, move, or delete a site or folder, all of your open web browsers will reload to correctly show the change. This allows you to have NewsBlur open at home and at work, knowing they will be synced when you change or add sites.

You may be thinking to yourself, 1, 3, and 7 days back makes sense, but why 14 if the unread limit is at 14 days? Why, having 14 days as an option would only make sense if the full limit was… (stay tuned).
