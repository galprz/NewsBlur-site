I’m not sure what else you would search for, honestly. If not vanilla pizza, then perhaps a sicilian, or montanara, a deep-dish, slices of neapolitan, whole-wheat thin-crust, or stuffed crust?

Well now you can search for pizza to your heart’s content on the [NewsBlur Android app](http://www.newsblur.com/android). Good luck with your tomato pie.
