Used to be that a friend shares a story without commenting on it and youâ€™d be out of luck in trying to reply or thank them for sharing it.

Not anymore! Comment-less shares now have the ability to be replied to and favorited. Take a look at this recent story on [The People Have Spoken](http://popular.newsblur.com/story/a-plea-for-culinary-/ee1275).

These new comments are immediately available on the web and will be coming to iOS and Android shortly.
