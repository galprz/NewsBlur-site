A few small new features to get your first full week of the new year started off right.

### Syntax highlight for source code

A common feature request has been automatic syntax highlighting in blog posts. This feature uses auto-detection to highlight code. For short snippets of code, this means that they could have inaccurate highlighting, although in testing it’s not so bad to have a few words in various colors. But for any substantial amount of code, you’ll have an easier time following along with syntax highlighting.

### Video fitting

Videos from Youtube and Vimeo (and a few others) are now stretched to fit the window, resulting in bigger video previews.

### Footnotes

Previously, if you clicked the little footnote reference<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, you would be taken to a new window. The Feed view now smoothly scrolls you to the footnote, where you can then return back to the footnote. Easy!
