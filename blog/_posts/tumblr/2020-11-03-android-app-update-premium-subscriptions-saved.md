For a point release this one sure is big. The Android app has been upgraded to include a bunch of features found on the web.

For one, premium subscriptions can now be purchased in the Android app itself. Reading by folder, saved story tags, searching and saved searches are all premium features that you can unlock directly in the app.

Also, saved searches are now at the bottom of your feed list. Take a look:

Heres’ the full list of version 10.1’s many new features:

- Premium subscriptions are now available on Android! Read by folder, saved story tags, searching, and more is exclusive to premium subscribers.
