[ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com), a native Mac app for reading Instapaper, Pocket, and NewsBlur on your desktop, completes the RSS reading trifecta. NewsBlur has a web app, native iOS app, and now a native Mac app.

While this is not an official app, it’s certainly the best desktop app for NewsBlur. In time more NewsBlur-specific features will be added, such as shared stories (blurblogs), training and separate unread counts in focus mode, and saved stories.

If you’re a developer and want to make your own NewsBlur app, use the free [NewsBlur API](http://www.newsblur.com/api). You can charge for your app and enjoy all of the benefits of the NewsBlur backend.

[Download ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com) to enjoy offline reading on your Mac.
