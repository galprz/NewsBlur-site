Today I’d like to announce the release of version 4.3.0 of the official NewsBlur Android app. Lots of goodies, bug fixes, speed ups, and more.

The best new feature on the app is the new Read Stories feed. Take a look.

Here’s what’s new in version 4.3.0:

- New Read Stories feed
- New comment-less shares
- Memory use reduction
- Modern http library for improved connection handling and reduced timeouts
- Many bugfixes around sharing, commenting, and replying to stories
- Fixed unread search order

The Android app just keeps getting better! Not bad for a minor point release.
