It was only a few months ago back in April that I launched [the new font and style manager](http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2014-04-10-the-new-font-and-style-manager.html). Today I’m coming back to finish the job.

The style manager now has a new control for choosing the font size of feed titles and story titles.

Choose from extra small to extra large. These new font sizes not only give you extra customization, but they allow you to have bigger touch sizes for folks using touch screen monitors.

If you spot anywhere else that you’d like to see additional customization, please shout out to the [@newsblur account on Twitter](http://twitter.com/newsblur) or post an idea on [NewsBlur’s Get Satisfaction support site](http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur).

And please continue to talk about how much you use NewsBlur. [Every tweet that talks positively about NewsBlur](https://twitter.com/newsblur/favorites) makes all of this work worthwhile.
