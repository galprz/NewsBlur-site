Search, which can easily be considered one of the most important features of a world-class news reader, is also one of the most difficult features to build.

While working on the feature, I came across a great method that allows searching through story titles, authors, and tags on a per-feed basis. It’s not perfect and it’s not the full feature, but this will get us 80% of the way there.

Also comes with a handy keyboard shortcut (and a refactored keyboard shortcut dialog).

You can also search your saved stories and shared stories. This feature will soon find it’s way to both Android and iOS, and is available today to all premium users.
