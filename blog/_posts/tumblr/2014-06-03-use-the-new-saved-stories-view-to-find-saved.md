After launching [Saved Story Tagging](http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2014-01-14-saved-story-tagging.html) earlier this year, I realized that there is an inherent categorization to every saved story: the site. But instead of just allowing you to search by site, I created a new view that you can now use to see stories saved by site.

The neat thing about this new view is that it works for folders, too. If you click on a containing folder, you’ll see the saved stories from all of the sites inside that folder. And thanks to last month’s full text search, you can search all of these saved stories.

And you should expect that these features will eventually make their way to iOS and Android.
