Today I’m launching [version 3.0 of the iPhone and iPad app for NewsBlur](http://www.newsblur.com/ios). This major update brings loads of big features that combine to make the world’s best iOS news reader with the fastest sync in town.

- Offline support - stories and images are downloaded quickly and in parallel.
- Syncing - read stories offline or with little connectivity.
- Preferences - override global order/read filter settings, configure offline, and other options.
- Send to - rewritten to include single-tap Instapaper/Readability/Pocket integration.
- Saved and shared stories now show the proper icon.
- Activities/interactions have been rewritten to be easier on the eyes.
- A major performance improvement when returning to the app and when initially syncing.

The biggest feature since this Spring’s redesign is finally here. As always, [the iOS app is a free download](http://www.newsblur.com/ios).
