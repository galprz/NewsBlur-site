NewsBlur has an amazingly active third-party app community, thanks to the [well documented NewsBlur API](http://www.newsblur.com/api). Today I’d like to introduce you to two new apps built by developers on the NewsBlur API.

## Hypersonic for Windows 10 & Windows Phone

[Hypersonic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/hypersonic/9nblggh5wnb6) is clean, simple, beautiful, and designed to run across both mobile and desktop devices.

## Add My Feed for iOS

[Add My Feed](http://addmyfeed.cubesoft.fr) is an extension allowing you to effortlessly add RSS feeds to your online reader of choice.

When you encounter a site you would like to subscribe to, simply tap the Add My Feed extension and you’re done !

Add My Feed works in Safari and in any app supporting the standard iOS share sheet.

Both of these apps and many more are on the [Goodies & Mobile Apps](http://www.newsblur.com/?next=goodies) dialog. If you’ve developed an app for NewsBlur and would like to add it to Goodies (and have it blogged about here), let me know!
