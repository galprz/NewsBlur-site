This is not just any font and style manager. You now have control over font size, line spacing, story layout, and type faces directly in the reading view. This nifty popover gives you quick access to all of these customizable features.

The type faces come from [Hoefler & Co.](http://www.typography.com) (née Hoefler & Frere-Jones) which is the premier web type foundry. It’s also one of the most expensive, but that’s where the incredible font quality comes from.

The four new fonts are:

### Gotham Narrow

### Whitney

### Chronicle

These new fonts are available immediately for premium users. Another great reason to pay for NewsBlur.
