This week’s update to the [official NewsBlur iOS app](http://www.newsblur.com/ios) brings a whole lot of oft-requested features and improvements. Here’s what’s new this month:

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"\><tr\><td\> ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios%204.5%20-%20full%20bleed.png)</td\> <td\> ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios%204.5%20-%20alt%20text.png)</td\> </tr\></table\>
- iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are now fully supported
- iOS 8 is also now fully supported (as well as iOS 7)
- Moving between the feed list, story list, and story detail is now much faster
- Images are now “full bleed”, extending to the entire width of the screen
- New preference for hiding feeds after they are read
- Long press images in a story to read the alt text
- Long press images in a story to save it to your camera roll
- Long press images in a story to zoom into it
- Long press links in a story to get an actions menu (safari, instapaper, bookmark, etc)
- Fixed all iOS 8 issues (preference panes, profile popovers)
- OvershareKit updated for iOS 8
- Pull to refresh updated to match theme
- Pull to refresh date is now localized

Next to come will be a native iOS share dialog, saved story tag editing, search, and possibly some features requested by users like you. If you have a feature request, post it as an idea on [the NewsBlur forum on Get Satisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur).
