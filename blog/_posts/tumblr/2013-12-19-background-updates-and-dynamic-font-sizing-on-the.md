This week brings us a minor, but major, update for [the NewsBlur iOS app](http://www.newsblur.com/ios). Several new features, some due to new APIs in iOS 7, have made it into the app.

Here’s what’s new:

- Background updates so NewsBlur can download stories while you sleep
- Custom text sizes for feeds and stories
- Dynamic text sizes based on your system preferences
- The story title is now linked to the original story
- New preference to use either the in-app browser, Safari, or Chrome
- Major iPad fixes include better transitions, bugs squashed, and improved performance

Coming up I have a big ticket feature that is just about ready to launch. Stay tuned for saved story tagging, which will also make its way into the Android and iOS app soon.
