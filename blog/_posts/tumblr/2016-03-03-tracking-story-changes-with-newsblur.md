NewsBlur has been tracking story changes for a long, long time now (first mentioned [on the blog five years ago in April 2011](http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2012-01-16-2011-year-in-review.html)). But I felt it was time for an upgrade and today I’m pleased to launch some changes to the story tracker.

If you use a third-party client to read NewsBlur, like Reeder, ReadKit, or Unread, you may have noticed strange <ins style="text-decoration: underline;color: #006600">revision</ins> change highlighters that cross out what gets edited out by a publisher and highlights what gets added.

This is great, except you probably don’t want this turned on for every single story.

By default you will now only see the final edit of the story. And if you are on the web you will see a new Show Story Changes button in the heading of any story that has seen changes.

You can also toggle back and forth between showing and hiding story changes, so you can take a peek behind the curtains and still come back to the read the story in its final, finished form.

This should relieve the burden of having to implement a story change tracker in third-party clients when almost no other news readers have this feature. So third-party reading app makers neglected to include support, leading to a less than ideal NewsBlur reading experience. No longer!
