Two big announcements today:

1. SSL is now available. You can use [**https** ://www.newsblur.com](https://www.newsblur.com) if that’s your thing.
2. Stripe.js integration means you can use a credit card to pay for a premium account.

In order to integrate [Stripe.js](http://www.stripe.com) into NewsBlur, I had to add SSL support, which was not the easiest task. Generating signing requests, signing certifications, and providing additional security is no basic task.

Since you’re reading this, it would be a safe assumption that you have already gone premium. To which, firstly, I thank you. And secondly, if you’re invested in the success of a product, you want to watch it grow. But that means you also will not have a chance to see the new payment form, so here’s the new premium upsell:

And the new payment form:

I’m extraordinarily pleased with how much easier this was relative to setting up PayPal about a year ago for recurring payments. Thanks to Stripe.js for being such a hassle-free payment provider.
