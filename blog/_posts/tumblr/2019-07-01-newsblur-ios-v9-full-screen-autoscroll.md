A whopper of a release with many, many new features!

- Autoscroll: Read long stories hands-free
- Full screen: Reading stories without the toolbar for a better experience
- Longer story titles: New options for longer and shorter story title and content previews in the story titles list
- Smaller image previews: New option for smaller image previews in the story titles list
- Show story changes: All stories with edits now show a “Show Changes” button at the top that lets you see the differences
- Return to last read story: When you return to the app, you will start where you left off
- Return to last read scroll position: When you return to a story, you will automatically scroll to where you left off

Take a look at some of the image and story title customizations you can now make:

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="968" data-orig-width="1068" data-orig-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v9.png"><img style="width:650px;margin: 24px auto;" data-orig-height="968" data-orig-width="1068" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v9.png"></figure>

There’s also many smaller fixes that improve the polish of the app:

- If you had a slow connection, some stories would take a while to draw while images were downloaded. Now they show immediately
- Support for larger iPad Pros
- Suport for iOS 13
- Fixes for split mode on iPad
- Fixes for marking stories as read while scrolling the story titles list
- Fixes for navigating stories with an external keyboard
- Fixes for scroll performance on the feed list and the story titles list
- Fixes for sharing stories accidentally having double titles in emails and messages
