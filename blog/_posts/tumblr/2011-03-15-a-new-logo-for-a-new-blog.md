We’ve come a long way, readers. What started as a fun project to scratch an itch has become a fun project that pays for its ever-increasing self. This week I’m going to show how motivated I am about turning NewsBlur into a serious blog reader. And it starts with a collection of a circles:

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7bc39090e65c93d25c183d34feef0697/9acad7bd3a38ca12-aa/s540x810/af26a4e5fc93ac78867704956f89508c2bfc3a3d.png" data-orig-height="500" data-orig-width="500"></figure>

What may take you, somebody who has done more than only crop images in an image editor, only a few minutes took me on the order of 1-2 hours a day over 5 days. It’s always like this. Slow as sin until you start to pick up how the editor wants you to work. Then it’s gravy. I could, in fact, completely redo the logo in 10 minutes on a blank canvas. That’s how it goes.

The biggest difference is not the new logo, which sits comfortably underneath your sites when reading, but the new favicon.

<figure data-orig-height="16" data-orig-width="16"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d1157d27999b31a8e085ac6ad7180523/9acad7bd3a38ca12-51/s540x810/7a0ffd42b679efab43f012e6323092835c2e9ff2.png" data-orig-height="16" data-orig-width="16"></figure>

This little guy sits there, staring at you the whole time, and reminding you where you are. He had to be created separately, but once you know what the hell a mask is, resizing and showing exaggerated pixels is child’s play.
