This month’s new iOS features are big, big features. Search made it on the web only a few months ago and is now available on the iOS app. You can also now easily add tags to saved stories, making it easier to organize and save stories you read for re-reading later.

Here’s the full list of new features:

- Search feeds and folders.
- Fixing rotation issues so you can watch a video and rotate without losing position.
- Saved story tagging: add and remove tags with a handy tagging popover.
- Native controls for sending a story to other services (mail, safari, chrome, evernote, instapaper, etc).
- Progress bar for the Story view when loading a story using the in-app browser.
- Further UI cleanups and memory fixes/speedups for iOS 8.

It’s a [free download](https://www.newsblur.com/ios) from the App Store. And if you are enjoying the app, please leave a 5 star review on the App Store. Every positive review, tweet, and share on Facebook helps.
