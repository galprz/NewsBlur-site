Check it out, David Berlin built [Newsreel](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id1080200978?mt=8), a NewsBlur client for Apple TV. And from my first impression, it rocks. Just take a look at these screenshots.

You can read your subscriptions as well as subscribe to new sites, right from your television.

Not only does it look polished, but it’s smooth and seamless. Take a look at how it works in practice.

You can download [download Newsreel on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id1080200978?mt=8). What a beautiful app and it goes to show how nice it is to be able to read your news on a big screen.
