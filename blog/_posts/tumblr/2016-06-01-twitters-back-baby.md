It’s been too long. Twitter [unceremoniously knee-capped their API](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/api-v1-retirement-final-dates) a few years ago and a number of solutions popped up to fix the loss. However, those stopgaps also closed and left us with no good ways to read Twitter while in NewsBlur. Until now, that is.

You can now subscribe to **[https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/)_username_** to get individual Twitter accounts on NewsBlur. Put them all in a folder to recreate your tweetstream.

Not only do you get the full tweetstream for that user, but you can also filter out tweets that are replies, retweets, or contain any text in them. You can also train Twitter feeds to highlight tweets that contain photos, are retweeted or liked, or have a word you want.

YouTube also deprecated their API and NewsBlur came to the rescue with [native YouTube API support](http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2015-04-30-a-real-solution-to-the-deprecated-youtube-api.html). Now Twitter joins that list of native support, giving you a better Twitter experience than ever before.

And because this native Twitter support takes more work than normal RSS feeds do, this feature is only available to premium subscribers.
