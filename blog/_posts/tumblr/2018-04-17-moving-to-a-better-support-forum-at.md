It’s about time NewsBlur had more control of its own support forums. For the past 7 years (to the week!), NewsBlur has been using Get Satisfaction for support, ideas, questions, and praise.

In that time the forums have hosted 6,959 conversations with 6,432 members. And all of that has been imported into the new support forum at [https://forum.newsblur.com](https://forum.newsblur.com).

Every topic, every post, every like, and every user is still there. The URLs have changed but the search function is alive and well.

Here’s the story with your account. It’s still there and you can inherit all of your posting history. But to use your account you will have to go through the forgot password flow, as the passwords were not able to be imported.

Or create a new account. The point of the forum is to post ideas and questions and problems, so if your posting history doesn’t come with you, it’s not a big deal. It’s not like anybody answering the forums looks at your post count and decides whether or not to dive deeper into your question.

I try to do my best in answering every single support thread. At the rates we’ve seen with nearly 7,000 posts in 7 years, that’s an average of 3 per day. Let’s keep the posts coming!

And if you’re wondering about why I decided to upgrade, the answer is that the new forum software, [Discourse](https://discourse.org), is open-source and allows me to better integrate the forums into other parts of NewsBlur. I have plans to build out the staff in the coming weeks and part of that includes a better support system.

Thanks to Get Satisfaction for all the years of service. You and your cupcake avatars will be missed.
