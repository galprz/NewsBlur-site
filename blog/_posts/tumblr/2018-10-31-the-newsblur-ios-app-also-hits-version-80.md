Fresh off the heels of the Android app hitting version 8.0, today I’d like to announce the latest update to the iOS app. This is a huge release and it’s got a lot of new features packed in it. I also want to welcome David Sinclair back to the team. He’s the builder behind all the incredible features in this release. Really wonderful having you back, David, and thanks for making v8.0 of the best news reader on a phone.

Here’s what’s new:

- NEW: Save stories offline
- NEW: Share stories from other apps into NewsBlur with the new share extension
- NEW: Scroll vertically between stories (can be turned on while reading a story)
- NEW: 3D Touch links in stories to preview them
- NEW: search for sites directly from the feed list
- Switching themes no longer reloads the story
- iOS 12 compatibility fixes
- Upgrading to a premium subscription now handles App Store payment updates
- Fixed issue where locking the device while playing a video over Airplay would stop the video

Here’s a preview of what a 3D touch on a link looks like:

And sharing stories from other apps directly to your blurblog is now easy to do from the share menu.

Now that David’s back there’s a lot to look forward to.
